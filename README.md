## Installation

WIP

## How to get started
This project is writtin using the principles defined in [effective go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) (please read it if you haven't yet). If you are looking for additional resources on how to become familuar with go, check out these resources on the [go wiki](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Learn).
1. Instal go
  * From the web -> https://golang.org/doc/install
  * From choco -> choco install golang
2. Install glide
  * [Glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide) is a dependency manager for golang, and we'll use it to manage dependecies in this project.

## Getting Started With Go
So, you want to learn go? Awesome - we don't have all of the answers but we can give you a starting point.

### The Go Playground
This [online sandbox](https://play.golang.org) will give you an enviroment in which to test what you learn without relying on any installations on your local machine. 

### Effective Go
Known as the holy grail of golang documentation, as it explains:
* Creating variables, structs, interfaces, and other keywords and controls 
* How to use defer, correct pointer usage, and errors
* Managing in-memory data using arrays, slices, matricies, and maps
* How to avoid shaddowing, prevent buffer leakage, and when to panic
* Using concurency through go routines, channels, and parallization
* Resolving types by inversion of control using interfaces and type-casting
* Managing memory, embedding, and several go-unique principles

Read on in effective go [here](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html).

### The Little Go Book
This is a more extensive read than effective go, but it has greater detail. Find the Little Book [here](https://www.openmymind.net/assets/go/go.pdf).
