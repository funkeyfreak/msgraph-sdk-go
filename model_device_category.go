// DeviceCategory Device categories provides a way to organize your devices. Using device categories, company administrators can define their own categories that make sense to their company. These categories can then be applied to a device in the Intune Azure console or selected by a user during device enrollment. You can filter reports and create dynamic Azure Active Directory device groups based on device categories.
type DeviceCategory struct {
	// Optional description for the device category.
	Description string `json:"description,omitempty"`
	// Display name for the device category.
	DisplayName string `json:"displayName,omitempty"`
